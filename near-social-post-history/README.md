# DevGigsBoard Editing History Widget
The widget allows users to view the editing history of posts on DevGigsBoard, a platform for developers to share their work and connect with potential clients. The editing history is stored on a smart contract and can be accessed through this widget.

## Features
The following features have been implemented in the widget:

- Dropdown menu with timestamps and accounts corresponding to when and who edited a webpage
- Clicking a timestamp opens the webpage with the post the way it looked after that edit
- Selecting two timestamps opens a diff window that shows what parts of the post have changed between the two selected timestamps

## Getting Started

- Go to https://near.social/#/markeljan.near/widget/PostWithHistory?id=164
- Find a post that you want to view the editing history for
- Click on the "Editing History" button located on the post card
- Select the desired timestamp from the dropdown menu
- The post will be displayed as it looked after that edit
- To compare two timestamps, select the first timestamp from the dropdown menu, then hold down the Shift key and select the second timestamp
- A diff window will appear, showing what parts of the post have changed between the two selected timestamps
